Pokemon Map Builder

This application is ran by importing javascript directly into the browser as a client-side application. The application utilizes Javascript and JQuery.

It is a pokemon map builder that offers multiple swatches that are loaded in as PNGs.

These swatches can then be used to dynamically customize a pokemon map canvas. Each unit in the canvas can be replaced with a new swatch and the user can drag-draw across the canvas for ease-of-use.

The canvas also has a character/player sprite of Pikachu that can move with arrow keys and emulates obstable interaction by not being able to move past certain objects (i.e. rocks, fences, water). This is done using mouse event handlers.

The application also allows for previewing of swatches by temporarily replacing the current tile that the mouse cursor is hovering over to showcase what it would look like if the user were to click and replace the tile.
